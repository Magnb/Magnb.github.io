## Organization of Austria's Power Sector
\label{sec:electricityOrganization}

### Control Zones

The European electricity system is organized into control zones (or control areas), each managed by a transmission system operator (TSO) responsible for maintaining supply-demand balance within its geographical boundaries. Austria forms a single control zone operated by the national transmission system operator Austrian Power Grid (APG), while neighboring countries like Germany operate multiple control zones. These zones are interconnected through transmission lines that enable cross-border electricity trading and mutual support during system imbalances. The control zone concept is fundamental to both market operation and system stability, as it defines the scope of balancing responsibilities and establishes the framework for international market coupling \cite{apg-netzregelung}.

### Balancing Group Model
\label{subsec:back-bgm}
The balancing group model forms the foundation of Austria's liberalized electricity market. Introduced alongside the unbundling of energy trading and grid operation, it reflects principles established in the Scandinavian market model \cite{apcs}.

Balancing groups are virtual accounting units that aggregate producers and consumers within a control area, with the obligation to maintain a net energy balance in quarter-hourly (15-minute) intervals. Inflows stem from own generation or market purchases, while outflows result from electricity sales or end-user supply. Although generation units may be distributed across multiple groups, each consumption point is assigned exclusively to one. The Balancing Responsible Party (BRP) ensures that injections and withdrawals remain balanced. Deviations—typically arising from forecast errors or unplanned outages—are offset by the transmission system operator (TSO) via balancing energy. The associated costs are allocated according to the causation principle, whereby the party responsible for imbalances bears the financial consequences.
This model not only enables the real-time balancing of electricity but also provides the institutional framework for balancing energy procurement, deviation settlement, and financial accountability across market participants \cite{wawer2022a,apg-strommarktmodell}.

### Schedule Management and Gate Closure Process
The operational framework of balancing groups is supported by a structured schedule management process. Balancing group managers must submit binding notifications of planned energy delivery to the TSO by 2:30 p.m. on the previous day for the following day's delivery. However, schedule modifications remain possible until gate closure through wholesale market trading (see Chapter~\ref{sec:wholesales}), provided the required lead time is met.
Gate closure serves as the absolute deadline for any schedule changes, with different timing requirements based on transaction type. 
In Austria (APG area), continuous intraday trading remains open until delivery for intra-control area trades and until 30 minutes before delivery for cross-border transactions. In contrast, countries such as Germany and Switzerland apply an intra-control area gate closure of five minutes, while cross-border trades close uniformly 30 minutes before delivery.
The submitted schedules serve as the basis for TSO congestion management, particularly when transmission capacities between control areas are scarce.
For the TSOs, the Gate Closure Time (GCT) marks the start of the process to align electricity flows between control areas \cite{wawer2022a,epexspot2022fundamentals}.


### Balancing Markets
Balancing markets ensure real-time system stability by correcting deviations between scheduled and actual electricity flows that occur after GCT or even during delivery. Such imbalances can result from renewable forecast errors, unexpected load variations, or unplanned generation outages. This leads to under- or over-covered balancing groups — where energy withdrawals exceed or fall short of scheduled injections.
To restore balance, TSOs activate balancing energy: positive balancing energy is supplied when a group is under-covered, while negative balancing energy is absorbed when a group is over-covered. BRPs are charged or compensated based on their imbalance volumes. In Austria, the Austria Power Clearing and Settlement AG (APCS) acts as the balance group coordinator for the APG control area, determining deviations and managing settlement.
Balancing energy is defined as the deviation between the scheduled and actual energy in each quarter-hourly settlement period. Pricing is determined based on the cost of activated balancing reserves. For positive deviations (surplus injection), the balancing energy price is the minimum of: the weighted average price of activated negative balancing energy, the exchange price indicator, and a scarcity component. For negative deviations (shortfall), the price is the maximum of the corresponding positive energy prices. These mechanisms ensure cost-reflective and scarcity-sensitive pricing, which in turn incentivizes accurate forecasting and schedule compliance \cite{wawer2022a,apg-strommarktmodell}.
